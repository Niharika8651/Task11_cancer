# Task 11 – SVM Breast Cancer Classification

## Objective
Classify breast cancer tumors using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Dataset
Breast Cancer dataset generated using sklearn and saved as CSV.

## Steps
1. Loaded dataset and inspected features
2. Applied StandardScaler
3. Split data into train and test sets
4. Trained SVM with RBF kernel
5. Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
6. Evaluated model using confusion matrix and classification report
7. Plotted ROC curve and calculated AUC
8. Saved trained model

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Output
- ROC Curve
- Classification Report
- Saved SVM model
